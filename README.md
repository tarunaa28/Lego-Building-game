User story: Lego Building game with load/save functionality

To develop innovative lego block games that ignite players' creativity, I aim to utilize the Lego building game to design and construct various structures, fostering exploration and creative expression.

Scenario: Building with lego Blocks

Initial setup:


When the Lego Building game is launched, all of the lego blocks are initially hidden. The user is presented with a list of buttons to choose from.

User interaction:

When the user clicks on any of the buttons from the list, the corresponding lego block becomes visible. Then, the user can place the lego block anywhere on the provided checkerboard tile.

Interaction with the placed blocks:

When the user clicks another button from the list, the corresponding selected block becomes visible. If the user clicks on the existing block of the same color, the newly selected block sits on top of the selected block.

Managing unwanted actions: 

The user has the option to click somewhere else to stop an activity if they choose a Lego brick but then decide against placing it.
If the user chooses a different colored Lego brick to place one on top of another, Placement actions are canceled.

Acceptance criteria:

In this Lego building game, we want to make sure that players can easily build structures and save their progress. So, we need to check a few things: First, when players choose a Lego block and click on the floor, it should place the block where they want it. If they want to stack blocks on top of each other, they should be able to do that easily too. Second, they should be able to save what they've built by clicking on a clear "save" button. This should remember exactly how they placed the Lego blocks. Third, when they come back to play again, they should see an option to load their saved creation. This should bring back exactly what they built before. Lastly, the game should be easy to understand. Players should be able to figure out how to select and place blocks without any trouble. We'll also provide clear instructions on how to set up the game and use the save/load feature.
